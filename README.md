# Topic-Modeling-with-R

## Problem Statement
Perform topic modeling for 4 books:
1. The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, by Mark Twain  
2. Little Women by Louisa May Alcott  
3. The Time Machine by H. G. Wells  
4. Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen  

## Steps
1. Introduction.  
2. Download these four books from Project Gutenbergr.  
3. Divide these four books into chapters and treat them as documents.  
4. Remove stop_words.  
5. Count number of words in each document.  
6. Convert the document into a document-term-matrix. 
7. Use the topicmodels package to create a four topic LDA model. 
8. Find the top 5 terms within each topic.  
9. Visualize the word count for each topic.  
10. Find out which topics are associated with each document and check if we could put the chapters back together in the correct books.
